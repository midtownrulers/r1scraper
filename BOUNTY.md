# Rank One Sport web scraper bounty

We, Midtown Rulers, are offering a $300 bounty + $75 donation to open source libraries to the first person who creates a web scraper in Node.js + TypeScript for Rank One Sport as defined in the Bounty Objective. Rank One Sport is the sole broker for sports information for K-12 schools in Texas; Midtown Rulers is looking to leverage this reservoir to create unique digital experiences for the youth basketball community.

## Bounty Objective

Create a Typescript program using Node.js to scrape data (parse the DOM) from Rank One Sport districts. The program should implement the Classes and Functions defined in the `scraper.d.ts` file that is attached below.

[View scraper.d.ts](./scraper.d.ts)

## Bounty Rules

- The code must be hosted on a public GitHub repository with a license that is compatible with the GNU Public License version 3.0
- You must not commit any offenses that are related to the making of the program

## Bounty Submissions

Submit a pull request to the [midtownrulers/r1scraper](https://github.com/midtownrulers/r1scraper) repository on GitHub.  Reese Armstrong (reesericci), will conduct a code review, and then merge the pull request if you are the winner.

#### Payouts

We will pay you out in a convenient way for both you and us. Most likely PayPal.
